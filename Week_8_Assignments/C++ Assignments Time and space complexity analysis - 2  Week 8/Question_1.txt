Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for(int j = 0; j * j < n; j++) {
cout << “PhysicsWallah ”;
}
}

Answer:- O(n√n). As inner loop is independent of outer so outer runs for n times, while 
        the inner loop runs for √n times, so both gets multiplied. Hence final time 
        complexity is O(n√n).
