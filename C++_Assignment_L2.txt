Ques 1:  Find the output for this code .

int x;
cout<<”Enter first number\n”;
cin>>x;  // user will give ‘x’ a value.
int y,m;
cout<<”Enter second number and value for taking modulus\n”;
cin>>y>>m;  // user will give ‘y’ a value.
int Z= (x*y)%m;
cout<<”Output is :”<<Z;

Ans- Suppose the user gives 12 as value for x, 4 as y and value
    for taking modulus is 3.
    Thus, the equation becomes (12 * 4)%3
    Since, parenthesis has the highest precedence among these, thus operations in 
    parenthesis will take place first.
    => 48 % 3
    => 0

Ques 2: Find the output for this code .


int x;
cout<<”Enter first number\n”;
cin>>x;  // user will give ‘x’ a value.
int y;
cout<<”Enter second number\n”;
cin>>y;  // user will give ‘y’ a value.
cout<<(x! = y)<<” “<<(x>=y);

Ans- Let us consider that user gives value 32 to x and 4 to y. Now, (x != y) is True as 32
    is not equal to 4, thus it returns 1. Then " " is encountered. Next, (x >= y) is also
    True as 32 > 4. So, the final output will be 1 1. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ques 3: Find the output for this code .


int x,y;
cin>>x>>y;
x+=y;
x-=y;
x%=y;
cout<<x;

Ans- Suppose user gives x = 10 and y = 5.
    Then is goes to line 3, where it encounters x+=y => x = x+y
    Thus x = 10+5 => x = 15.
    Then it goes to line 4, where it encounters x-=y => x = x-y
    Thus x = 15-5 => x = 10.
    Then it goes to line 5, where it encounters x%=y => x = x%y
    Thus x = 10%5 => x = 0.  
    Thus, the final output will be 0.

Ques 4: WAP for finding the volume of cylinder by taking radius and height as input.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int rad, height;
    const float PI = 3.14;
    float vol;
    cout<<"Enter the value for radius of cylinder: "<<endl;
    cin>>rad;
    cout<<"Enter the value for height of cylinder: "<<endl;
    cin>>height;
    vol = PI*r*r*h;
    cout<<"Volume of cylinder is: "<<vol<<endl;
}

Ques 5: WAP to find the difference between ASCII of two characters ,take them as input .

#include<iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char p,q;
    int a,b;
    cout<<"Enter value for char 1";
    cin>>p;
    cout<<"Enter value for char 2";
    cin>>q;
    a = (int)p;
    b = (int)q;
    cout<<"The difference between their ASCII values is: "<< abs(a-b)<<"."<<endl;
}

Ques: Find the output.

int i =  ( 4 + 7 / 5 * 6 * 6+9  )% 100  ;
cout<<i;

Ans- Since, parenthesis has the highest precedence, thus the equation in it is executed first.
=> (4 + 1 * 6 * 6 + 9)%100
=> (4 + 6 * 6 + 9)%100
=> (4 + 36 + 9)%100
=> (49)%100
=> 49. By using property if a < b, then a%b = a.
Thus, final answer is 49.
