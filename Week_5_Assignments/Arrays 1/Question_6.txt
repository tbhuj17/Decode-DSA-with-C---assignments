Predict the output:- 

int main()
{
int sub[50], i ;
for ( i = 0 ; i <= 48 ; i++ ) ;
{
sub[i] = i ;
cout<<sub[i]<<endl ;
}
return 0;
}

Answer:- The answer is 49 will be printed as for loop is empty, thus it will iterate till end and 
        value of i will be 49, which will be stored at position sub[49], and hence 49 will be printed 
        in output.
