In a singly linked list, deletion of data requires modification of how many pointers?
1
2
3
Depends upon the node being deleted.

Answer:- 2. As, while deleting any element, we modify 2 pointers. When we have to
        delete any element from head, then we point the head to head->next.

        When we have to delete an element from tail, then we travel to second last
        element and then set temp->next = NULL, then point tail to temp, which involves
        two pointers.

        When we have to delete an element at any index, then we move to idx-1 position, 
        and then temp->next = temp->next->next. In this way, we delete.
