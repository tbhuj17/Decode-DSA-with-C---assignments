Which of the following sorting algorithms is used along quicksort to sort the sub arrays?
a. Merge Sort
b. Selection Sort
c. Insertion Sort
d. Bubble Sort

Answer:- Insertion sort. As in quick sort, we find a pivot element and then arrange their left
        and right sub arrays and check whether they are in correct position or not. Thus this 
        works as Insertion sort.
