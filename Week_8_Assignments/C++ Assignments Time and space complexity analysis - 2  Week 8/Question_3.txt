Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.

int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for(int j = 1; j * j < n; j *= 2) {
c++;
}
}

Answer:- O(n*log n). As outer loop runs for n times and the inner loop runs for âˆšn times
        which turns into 1/2*log n. Outer loop rus for n times and inner loop is independent
        of outer. Thus both gets multiplied and T.C. becomes 1/2*n*log n. Which can be equated 
        to O(n*log n).
