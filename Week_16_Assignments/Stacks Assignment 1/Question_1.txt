You have two stack and 1,2,3,4,5 values and you have pushed all these values to S1 (in the order
1,2,3,4,5) and then you took 2 elements from top and inserted into S2 , then pop 1 element from S1
and then take top of S2 and insert into S1. What is the second top element in S1.

Answer:- [2]. When we remove two top elements from S1, then 5 and 4 gets popped from S1 and
        gets puhed into S2, then we remove tpo element from S1, thus 3 gets popped. Next we 
        push top element of S2 to S1. Thus 4 gets pushed in to stack. Hence, 2 has second
        position from top in S1.
