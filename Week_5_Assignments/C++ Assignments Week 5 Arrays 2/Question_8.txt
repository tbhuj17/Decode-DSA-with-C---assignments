double getAverage(int arr[], int size);
int main () {
int balance[5] = {1000, 2, 3, 17, 50};
double avg;
avg = getAverage( balance[0], 5 ) ;
cout << "Average value is: " << avg << endl;
return 0;
}

Answer:- The error is in line 5, we are passing a value i.e. balance[0], which is an integer value
            but the function needs an array or pointer to that array.
