Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.

int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for(int j = 1; j < n; j *= 2) {
c++;
}
}

Answer:- O(n*log n). As the inner loop runs for n times which is equated to 2^x, by which 
            x becomes log n. And the inner loop is independent of outer thus both gets multiplied
            in return the time complexity becomes O(n*log n).
