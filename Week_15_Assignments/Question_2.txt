void traverse(Node* head) {
while(head and head->next) {
cout << head->data << ‘ ‘;
head = head->next->next;
}
}
1 2 3 4 5
1 3 5
2 4
1 3

Answer:- 1 3 

This is because, head is skipping one iteration in while loop, while it is modifying,
As as result, 2 gets skipped. The 5 is not printed because head->next condition becomes 
false. Thus the outpit becomes 1 3.
